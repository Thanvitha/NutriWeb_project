A food products database
Open Food Facts is a free, open, collbarative database of food products from around the world, with ingredients, allergens, nutrition facts and all the tidbits of information we can find on product labels.

Made by everyone
Open Food Facts is a non-profit association of volunteers.
5000+ contributors like you have added 600 000+ products from 150 countries using our Android, iPhone or Windows Phone app or their camera to scan barcodes and upload pictures of products and their labels.

For everyone
Data about food is of public interest and has to be open. The complete database is published as open data and can be reused by anyone and for any use. Check-out the cool reuses or make your own!
